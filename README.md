# Abstract data types in Go

A few abstract data types that I programmed using Go, to get comfortable with the language.
Some of them should be pretty similar to the ones in the Go `container` package, but I would not use mine in any case. :)

I followed a TDD approach to check specifications of the ADT and check all is well done.

So far, the repository contains:

- Linked lists

Planned to continue with:

- AVL trees
- Hash table
